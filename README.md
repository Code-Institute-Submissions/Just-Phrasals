<h1 align="center"><strong>Just Phrasals Website</strong></h1>

[View live project here]()

The Just Phrasals website is a platform designed for the learning and practice 
of phrasal verbs, one of the most difficult parts of the language for many English 
language learners. Phrasal verbs are verb expressions made up of a verb + preposition(s), 
where the meaning is not always clear as it can often be idiomatic. 

For example, most language learners will understand “look”, but not verbs like “look over”, 
“look up to” or “look down on”, they will be familiar with “run”, but not “run into” or 
“run out of”; they will now “give”, but not “give up”, “give out” or “give into”.

There are 1000s of phrasal verbs and learners will never learn and use them all unless 
they develop native-level mastery of English. But the Just Phraslas website is designed 
to be a fun and interactive way to learn some of the most common phrasal verbs, where the 
user is introduced to the verbs and then undertake an exercise to practice and assimilate 
the verbs learned in the lessons. 

The format of the website takes the style of a traditional language-learning workbook, 
but made more dynamic thanks to interactive elements made available through a digital 
platform, including audio, interactive quizzes, instant feedback on answers submitted and 
other elements to click and toggle. This first version of the Just Phrasals website is designed 
to be a “bite-size”, “free sample course”, after which the users are prompted to “sign up” 
(itself a phrasal verb) for the full course for a reasonable fee. (Design of the full course was 
beyond the scope of this project, but the elements and process to sign up for said course have 
been included to demonstrate functionality of that process).
