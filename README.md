<h1 align="center"><strong>Just Phrasals Website</strong></h1>

[View live project here]()

The Just Phrasals website is a platform designed for the learning and practice
of phrasal verbs, one of the most difficult parts of the language for many English
language learners. Phrasal verbs are verb expressions made up of a verb + preposition(s),
where the meaning is not always clear as it can often be idiomatic.

For example, most language learners will understand “look”, but not verbs like “look over”,
“look up to” or “look down on”, they will be familiar with “run”, but not “run into” or
“run out of”; they will now “give”, but not “give up”, “give out” or “give into”.

There are 1000s of phrasal verbs and learners will never learn and use them all unless
they develop native-level mastery of English. But the Just Phraslas website is designed
to be a fun and interactive way to learn some of the most common phrasal verbs, where the
user is introduced to the verbs and then undertake an exercise to practice and assimilate
the verbs learned in the lessons.

The format of the website takes the style of a traditional language-learning workbook,
but made more dynamic thanks to interactive elements made available through a digital
platform, including audio, interactive quizzes, instant feedback on answers submitted and
other elements to click and toggle. This first version of the Just Phrasals website is designed
to be a “bite-size”, “free sample course”, after which the users are prompted to “sign up”
(itself a phrasal verb) for the full course for a reasonable fee. (Design of the full course was
beyond the scope of this project, but the elements and process to sign up for said course have
been included to demonstrate functionality of that process).

## <strong>UX</strong>

### <strong><u>User Stories</u></strong>

<em>After extensive evaluation of the profiles of English language learners in our modern digital world,
the website was created for the the following user profiles:</em>

- #### Intermediate/Advanced English-language learners

As phrasal verbs are generally considered elements beyond the level of beginners, the website has been designed
for intermediate and advanced English learners who already have a decent grasp of the language. With this in mind,
the developer has tailored the level of language, verbs and exercises in the website for these intermediate/advanced learners.
Although that is by no means to say that high-level beginners cannot learn phrasal verbs and there are plenty of
useful, basic phrasal verbs that a beginner can “pick up”. The developer of this project has considered that later versions
of this free Just Phrasals course could be broken into six separate sections for Beginner (1 & 2), Intermediate (1 & 2), and
Advanced (1 & 2), where users work their way up through the levels like a video game. This would provide for a more complete
and lengthy experience before users eventually commit to signing up for the full paid course(s). However, that is beyond
the scope of this current project, which currently includes one intermediate-level “bite-size”, “free-sample” course,
broken into five exercises to complete (more on that in the XXX section).

- #### Adult learners of English

The Just Phrasals website is mainly aimed at adults and older students (from around 18 upwards) is that is reflected in the design,
styling, tone and content language used, images used, exercise content and overall nature of the site.

- #### Learners from around the globe

With English being the lingua franca for the world of business, travel, politics, (not to mention TV series and films),
the global market of adult English language learners around the world is huge -- from European countries like Spain, Italy
and France, to Latin America, Middle East and Asia, as well as expats living in English-speaking countries like the US, the UK,
Ireland and Australia. For many, learning English is essential for their job or social life, and the Just Phrasals website is
designed to help them with a very particular aspect of the language that many struggle with. And in that sense, as a standalone,
dynamic, interactive phrasal verb-focused website, it is a first of its kind.

The website is designed to be generally accessible for all English language learners around the globe no matter what their native tongue is.
The developer, though, is acutely aware of the fact that the website could be made more appealing and accessible if it had different versions
focused on learners from different regions. It was beyond the scope of this project, but later versions of the website (both the free course(s)
and eventual paid full course(s)) could include a dropdown menu where users could choose their native language. From there parts of exercises,
explanations, definitions, etc. could be included in their chosen native language, for example Spanish, French, Mandarin, etc. depending on
their native language chosen.

- #### Digital-savvy language learner Users

Outside the classroom, the traditional manner to learn English was in a book, particularly workbooks where the user would “pencil in”
the answers to exercises. But like in many other segments and industries, print media is dying and digital-savvy users with shorter
attention spans need more fun, dynamic and interactive ways to learn languages than from a printed book. This fact can be attributed
to the success of language learning apps like Lingo Bongo.

Just Phrasals has been designed with the user profile of this digital-savvy English-language learner in mind. Exercises are short,
text is not heavy and dense, interactive elements, like clickable buttons, interactive quizzes and other features are included to
keep the user’s attention and interest. For example, each phrasal verb definition/examples are hidden behind the “verb boxes”.
But users can toggle click to show/hide these definitions/examples, which is a nice feature that demands interactivity from the user,
while also ensuring the user is not bombarded with dense text on first glance (more on this can and other features will be explained
in more detail in the Feature section).
